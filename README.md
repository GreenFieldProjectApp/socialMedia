  User Story :

  As a busy professional, I want to be able to quickly and easily create blog posts for my personal website, 
 so that I can share my thoughts and experiences with others.

 I want to be able to access the app from any device, including my laptop, tablet, and smartphone,
  so that I can write and publish blog posts whenever inspiration strikes. The app should allow me to format my posts with headings, images, 
  and links, and save drafts so that I can come back to them later.

 I also want to be able to view analytics on my blog, such as the number of views and the sources of traffic, 
 so that I can understand how my content is performing and make informed decisions about future posts.

 Overall, I want a simple and user-friendly blog app that will allow me to focus on writing, 
 and take care of the technical details for me.
